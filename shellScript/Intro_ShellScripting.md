# Shell Scripting
Shell scripting is a programming method used to automate tasks in Unix/Linux operating systems. It involves writing a sequence of commands in a file that the shell can execute.

# Types of Shells
Different Unix/Linux shells support scripting. Some common ones include:

1.Bash (Bourne Again Shell) – The most widely used shell.
2.Sh (Bourne Shell) – The original Unix shell.
3.Csh (C Shell) – Syntax similar to the C programming language.
4.Ksh (Korn Shell) – A superset of the Bourne Shell with additional features.
5.Zsh (Z Shell) – Advanced shell with improved features.

# Why Use Shell Scripting?
Automation – Reduces repetitive tasks.
Efficiency – Executes system commands quickly.
Customization – Customizes the environment and workflow.
Task Scheduling – Works with cron jobs for scheduled execution.
System Administration – Manages files, processes, and system logs.

 # Basic Syntax:
1.A shell script file usually has a .sh extension.
2.The first line (shebang) defines the shell interpreter:
       #!/bin/bash
3.Commands are executed sequentially.
4.Comments begin with #.

# Example: Simple Shell Script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
