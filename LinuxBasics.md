## ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Linux

Linux is a free and open-source operating system, similar to Unix. It runs on various devices, including servers, computers, and smartphones. Linux is known for being stable, secure, and customizable, unlike Windows or macOS, where users have limited control.

## ðŸ”¹ What is the Linux Kernel?

The **Linux kernel** is the core of the operating system. It connects software with hardware, managing resources like memory, CPU, and storage.

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Linux Commands

Here are some common Linux commands:

| Command                     | Description                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `pwd`                       | Shows the current directory |
| `ls`                        | Lists files and folders     |
| `cd <directory>`            | Changes directory           |
| `mkdir <folder_name>`       | Creates a new folder        |
| `touch <file_name>`         | Creates an empty file       |
| `rm <file_name>`            | Deletes a file              |
| `rmdir <directory>`         | Removes an empty folder     |
| `cp <source> <destination>` | Copies files/folders        |
| `mv <source> <destination>` | Moves or renames files      |
| `cat <file_name>`           | Displays file contents      |
| `echo "text" > file.txt`    | Writes text to a file       |
| `chmod +x <file>`           | Makes a file executable     |
| `uname -a`                  | Shows system details        |
| `df -h`                     | Displays disk usage         |
| `free -m`                   | Shows memory usage          |

## ðŸ”¹ File and Directory Navigation

- `pwd` - Shows your current location.
- `ls -la` - Lists files with details, including hidden ones.
- `cd ..` - Moves one step up in the directory.
- `cd /` - Moves to the root directory.

## ðŸ”¹ Linux Kernel Components

The Linux kernel consists of:

- **Process Management** - Manages running programs.
- **Memory Management** - Handles system memory allocation.
- **File System Management** - Organizes and stores data.
- **Device Drivers** - Allows software to interact with hardware.
