Introduction to Python:
-Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
-It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
-Python is widely used in fields like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and cybersecurity.

Characteristics of Python:
Python has several characteristics that make it a preferred language among developers:

  ðŸ”¹ Easy to Learn & Use
      Python has a simple syntax that resembles the English language, making it beginner-friendly.

  ðŸ”¹ Interpreted Language
      Python does not need compilation. It is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.

  ðŸ”¹ Dynamically Typed
      No need to declare variable types (e.g., int, float). Python determines the type at runtime.

  ðŸ”¹ Object-Oriented & Functional
      Supports object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming, allowing different programming styles.

  ðŸ”¹ Platform Independent
      Python code can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) with minimal changes
